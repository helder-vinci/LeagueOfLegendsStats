<h3> Disclaimer </h3>
I wrote this after going partying -> Coding without sleep -> Code is messy and bad.
Also login is not fully implemented, just saying inb4 you come at me angry cause you lost your sanity.

edit: 24 august 2018 - apparently a vulnerability was found on thus version of electron so if you decide to use this shit updte it first

Peace!
