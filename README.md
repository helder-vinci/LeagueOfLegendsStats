<h3> Disclaimer </h3>
The code is messy but should work, if you want to use for whatever reason make sure you upgrade electron as the version used currently has a vulnerability. It should be fixed by just upgrading it, I can't assure that the app will work after the upgrade.

I would upgrade it and test it, but this was just done as a project and I don't have a plan on getting this as a more serious one.
